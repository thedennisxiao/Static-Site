# About

This is a simple static website generator that converts Markdown files to HTML.

## How It Works

The site uses a simple Node.js build script that:
1. Reads Markdown files from the `content` directory
2. Converts them to HTML using the `marked` library
3. Wraps them in HTML templates
4. Outputs static HTML files to the `dist` directory

## Technology

- **Markdown**: For writing content
- **Node.js**: For the build process
- **marked**: For Markdown parsing
- **HTML/CSS**: For the frontend

Simple, clean, and effective.
